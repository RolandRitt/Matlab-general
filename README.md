# Matlab-general
This repository collects matlab functions which belong to no specific
 topic. It collects functions which are used in *general*.

It currently includes the following functions:
*  **count2log10**: a helper function to scale counting matrices using log10; it further delets all 0 entries and replaces it with eps.
*  **isEven**: a helper function which checks if a numbe is even.
*  **isOdd**: a helper function which checks if a numbe is odd.
*  **StringMustBeMember**: checks if a sttring is within a list of strings


This toolbox is also mirrored to the [Matlab File Exchange](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71411-matlab-general).
It is heavily used in the [mdtsToolbox](https://github.com/RolandRitt/Matlab-mdtsToolbox).
